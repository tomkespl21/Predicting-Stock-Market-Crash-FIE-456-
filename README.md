# Predicting-Company-Stock-Returns-FIE-456-

This is a project for the course called "Big-Data with application in finance" 

In this project I will try predict whether returns of various companys go up or down and whether the volatility is high. 
For this I use the monthly data of CRSP and COMPUSTAT data sets and various macroeconomic variables.

After merging the data it is then used to run different machine learning algorithms i.e. Neural Network, k-nearest neighbors, gradient boosting machines and support vector machines.

I believe if succesfull this can give useful information for "short term" selling of stocks, if you need the cash for important reasons.
